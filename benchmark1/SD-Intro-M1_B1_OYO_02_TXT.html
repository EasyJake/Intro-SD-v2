<div>Cuisine of New Orleans</div>
<div>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</div>
<div>
  The cuisine of New Orleans encompasses common dishes and foods in New Orleans,
  Louisiana. It is perhaps the most distinctively recognized regional cuisine in
  the United States. Some of the dishes originated in New Orleans, while others
  are common and popular in the city and surrounding areas, such as the
  Mississippi River Delta and southern Louisiana. The cuisine of New Orleans is
  heavily influenced by Creole cuisine, Cajun cuisine, and soul food.[1][2]
  Seafood also plays a prominent part in the cuisine.[1] Dishes invented in New
  Orleans include po' boy and muffuletta sandwiches, oysters Rockefeller and
  oysters Bienville, pompano en papillote, and bananas Foster, among others.

  Creoles are descendants of the settlers in colonial Louisiana, especially New
  Orleans. Before Louisiana became a part of the United States in 1803, it was
  colonized for more than a century, first by France and then by Spain. The
  Creoles were the American-born offspring of these European settlers. Some
  Creoles are people of mixed race who also have West African and Native
  American ancestry. The Creoles, most of whom originally spoke a dialect of
  French, created a sophisticated and cosmopolitan society in colonial New
  Orleans.[3][4][5]

  Creole cuisine is a fusion, unique to the New Orleans area, of French,
  Spanish, West African, and Native American cuisine. It was also influenced by
  later immigrants from Germany, Italy (particularly Sicily), and other
  locations. Like French food, it sometimes makes use of rich sauces and complex
  preparation techniques. Creole dishes often include onions, bell peppers,
  celery, tomatoes, and okra.[6][7][8]

  Cajun cuisine is also based partly on French cuisine and also makes use of
  local ingredients such as onions, bell peppers, and celery. It tends to be
  hearty, rustic fare, complex in flavor but easier to prepare. The Cajuns are
  descendants of the Acadians, French-Canadian colonists who were expelled from
  the Maritimes by the British. Some of the Acadians settled in rural areas of
  southern Louisiana in the 1760s and 1770s. The Cajuns spoke their own dialect
  of French.[9][10][11] Cajun cuisine uses less fish and more shellfish, pork,
  and game than Creole cuisine. While not always spicy, Cajun food is known for
  its unique use of many seasonings, including garlic, hot peppers, and fil√©
  powder.[6][7][8]

  Soul food was created by the African-American descendants of slaves. It is
  closely related to the cuisine of the Southern United States, but its origins
  trace back to West Africa. It often features hearty, flavorful dishes made
  with economical ingredients. Soul food is very popular in New
  Orleans.[12][13][14]

  Seafood plays an important part in the cuisine of New Orleans. The city is
  located where the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico, so its
  residents have access to a rich variety of both saltwater and freshwater fish
  and shellfish.[15]
