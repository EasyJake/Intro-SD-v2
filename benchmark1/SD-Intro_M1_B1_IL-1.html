          The history of the Internet has its origin in information theory and
          the efforts to build and interconnect computer networks that arose
          from research and development in the United States and involved
          international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the
          United Kingdom and France.

          Computer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that
          began to consider time-sharing between computer users, and later, the
          possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. Independently,
          Paul Baran proposed a distributed network based on data in message
          blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet
          switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing
          a national commercial data network in the UK.

          The concept of data communication – transmitting data between two
          different places through an electromagnetic medium such as radio or an
          electric wire – pre-dates the introduction of the first computers.
          Such communication systems were typically limited to point to point
          communication between two end devices. Semaphore lines, telegraph
          systems and telex machines can be considered early precursors of this
          kind of communication. The telegraph in the late 19th century was the
          first fully digital communication system.

        <h3>Information theory</h3>
          <p>Fundamental theoretical work on information theory was developed by Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley in the 1920s. Information theory, as enunciated by Claude Shannon, in the 1948, provided a firm theoretical underpinning to understand the trade-offs between signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, and error-free transmission in the presence of noise, in telecommunications technology. This was one of the three key developments, along with advances in transistor technology (specifically MOS transistors) and laser technology, that made possible the rapid growth of telecommunication bandwidth over the next half-century.[16]
