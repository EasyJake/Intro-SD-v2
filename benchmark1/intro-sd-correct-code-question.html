          JPEG (/ˈdʒeɪpɛɡ/ JAY-peg)[2] is a commonly used method of lossy
          compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced
          by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted,
          allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality.
          JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss
          in image quality.[3] Since its introduction in 1992, JPEG has been the
          most widely used image compression standard in the world,[4][5] and
          the most widely used digital image format, with several billion JPEG
          images produced every day as of 2015.[6]

          The term "JPEG" is an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts
          Group, which created the standard in 1992.[7] JPEG was largely
          responsible for the proliferation of digital images and digital photos
          across the Internet, and later social media.[8]

            JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats. JPEG/Exif
            is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other
            photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/JFIF, it is the
            most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on
            the World Wide Web.[9] These format variations are often not
            distinguished, and are simply called JPEG.

          The MIME media type for JPEG is image/jpeg, except in older Internet
          Explorer versions, which provides a MIME type of image/pjpeg when
          uploading JPEG images.[10] JPEG files usually have a filename
          extension of .jpg or .jpeg. JPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of
          65,535×65,535 pixels,[11] hence up to 4 gigapixels for an aspect ratio
          of 1:1. In 2000, the JPEG group introduced a format intended to be a
          successor, JPEG 2000, but it was unable to replace the original JPEG
          as the dominant image standard.[12]
