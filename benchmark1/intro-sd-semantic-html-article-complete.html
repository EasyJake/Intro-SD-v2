  which technologies are improving the fastest.

  The societal impacts of technological change can be seen in many domains, from
  messenger RNA vaccines and automation to drones and climate change. The pace
  of that technological change can affect its impact, and how quickly a
  technology improves in performance can be an indicator of its future
  importance. For decision-makers like investors, entrepreneurs, and
  policymakers, predicting which technologies are fast improving (and which are
  overhyped) can mean the difference between success and failure.

  “The rate of improvement can only be empirically estimated when substantial
  performance measurements are made over long time periods,” says Anuraag Singh
  SM ’20, lead author of the paper. “In some large technological fields,
  including software and clinical medicine, such measures have rarely, if ever,
  been made.”

<div>Overlap and centrality</div>
<div>
  To find the patents that best represent a domain, the team built on previous
  research conducted by co-author Chris Magee, a professor of the practice of
  engineering systems within the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society
  (IDSS). Magee and his colleagues found that by looking for patent overlap
  between the U.S. and international patent-classification systems, they could
  quickly identify patents that best represent a technology.

  “Our method provides predictions of performance improvement rates for nearly
  all definable technologies for the first time,” Anuraag Singh.

  Distribution of predicted improvement rates (in percent per year) for all
  1,757 technology domains. Domains to the right of dashed red line are
  improving faster than 36.5 percent per year, the predicted rate for integrated
  chips according to Moore's law.
